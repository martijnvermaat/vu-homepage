Martijn Vermaat - Personal homepage at cs.vu.nl

This is the sourcecode that compiles to my personal homepage at the Vrije
Universiteit (located at http://www.cs.vu.nl/~mvermaat/).

It consists of a build.xml file for use with Apache Ant, content source files
in the content/ directory, an XSLT transformation for transforming content
source files to webpages, and related files like images and stylesheets.

See the LICENSE file for copyright and license information.


== USAGE ==

Run 'ant -projecthelp' for a list of build options. To build and validate
the homepage, just run ant with no options.


== NOTES ==

Deployment specific content is present in:

* /build.xml:
Deployment server and path.

* /etc/www/.htaccess:
Absolute path to 404 error document.

* /etc/www/404
Absolute paths to stylesheets and other website pages.


== PREREQUISITES ==

* Implementation of EXSLT date and time functions.

* Deploy target needs scp and sshexec tasks, which in
  turn need the jsch.jar library.
