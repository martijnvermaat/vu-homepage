This directory contains an experimental definition of the Lambda
Calculus in ASF+SDF intended for use in the ASF+SDF Meta Environment.

The definitions are based on the definitions presented by Arie van
Deursen in [Deu94] and adjusted by Martijn Vermaat for use in version
1.5.3 of the Meta Environment.

Please note that this has not been thoroughly tested and is likely to
contain bugs and/or sub-optimal constructions.


For only the syntax definition of the Lambda Calculus, use module
Lambda-Syntax. For full reduction in left-most order of Lambda terms,
use module Reduce.

Module Let, enabling the use of let bindings over Lambda terms, is
not working yet.
