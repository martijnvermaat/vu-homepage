/
/ First some assignments
a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
/
/ Show them
? a
? b
/
/ Some arithmetic
union         = a + b
crosssection  = a * b
difference    = a - b
symdifference = a | b
/
/ Show them
? union
? crosssection
? difference
? symdifference
/
/ Some more sets
c = {8, 9, 10}
d = {10, 11, 12}
/
/ Some operations
? a - b * c + d
? (a - (b * c)) + d
