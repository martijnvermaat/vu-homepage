Today is the <a href="http://defectivebydesign.org/en/blog/announce_day_against_drm"
class="external">Day Against DRM</a>, an initiative I support by replacing my homepage
with this statement. If you're looking for one of my other pages, come back tomorrow.

<h2>What is DRM?</h2>


<p>
Big players in the software and entertainment industry are developing techniques
to take control over your media, programs and devices. They call these techniques
Digital Rights Management (DRM), although the only 'right' DRM is about is their
right to restrict your freedoms. Here are a few things DRM techniques are designed
to disable you to do:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Playing the songs you bought a few months ago on your new iPod.</li>
<li>Enjoying your own music collection on your birthday party with a borrowed stereo.</li>
<li>Sharing the demo your band just recorded directly with your friends and fans.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What Digital Rights Management (DRM) is and why you should be worried about it
is explained in detail on a great number of other websites, see the links below.
</p>


<h2>Why is DRM evil?</h2>


<p>
I'll give you a few reasons why I think DRM is a bad thing:
</p>

<ul>
<li>DRM interferes with perfectly legal use of media, making it hard or impossible to do
things you're allowed to do by law.</li>
<li>Vendors do their best to make their DRM invisible and hope users won't notice it gets
installed on their systems. This is called spyware and can lead to unstable and insecure
computer systems when the <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=975"
class="external">DRM contains bugs</a>.</li>
<li>There is no such thing as a DRM 'standard', meaning that different implementations
are incompatible.</li>
<li>Wide-spread DRM adoption makes for a world where sharing is wrong by default and
discouraged. This is not the kind of culture I would want to see for the future.</li>
<li>DRM is actively being used by big software companies as part of a greater strategy to
create vendor lock-ins. Music bought from vendor X will play on devices by vendor X, but not
on devices by vendor Y.</li>
<li>By their very nature DRM implementations are technically flawed. Cory Doctorow explained
this in <a href="http://craphound.com/msftdrm.txt" class="external">a few sentences</a>
(read point 1).</li>
</ul>

<p>
More, and probably better articulated, reasons can be found elsewhere on the internet.
