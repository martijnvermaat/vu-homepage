<h1>About this website</h1>


<p>
This website was constructed with maximum accessibility for the less-abled
visitor in mind. No Javascript is used, and all pages are equally usable
with or without stylesheet. Alternate stylesheets provide two high-contrast
versions of the website.
</p>

<p>
Technically, all pages should be XHTML 1.1 strict with valid CSS 2. It is
a known fact they do not have the theoretically correct mimetype. Get over
it.
</p>

<p>
The entire website is generated from some XML source files with a simple
homegrown framework based on <a href="http://ant.apache.org/"
external="true">Apache Ant</a>.
</p>


<h1>Subversion</h1>


<p>
All content and sourcecode of this website is stored in my Subversion
repository, which also hosts sources of most of my other documents and
projects.
</p>

<p>
Although I will no longer make public references to the repository's address
here, most of its content is readable anonymously. If you want to browse the
source for anything on this website, just drop me a note.
