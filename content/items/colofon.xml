<p>
May you wish to contact me, this is my e-mail address:

<h1>About this website</h1>


<p>
This website was constructed with maximum accessibility for the less-abled
visitor in mind. No Javascript is used, and all pages are equally usable
with or without stylesheet. Alternate stylesheets provide two high-contrast
versions of the website.
</p>

<p>
Technically, all pages should be XHTML 1.1 strict with valid CSS 2. It is
a known fact they do not have the theoretically correct mimetype. Get over
it.
</p>

<p>
The entire website is generated from some XML source files with a simple
homegrown framework based on <a href="http://ant.apache.org/"
external="true">Apache Ant</a>.
</p>


<h1>Subversion</h1>


<p>
On some pages of this website, I make a reference to my Subversion
repository. Some projects on it are readable anonymously.
</p>

<p>
For example, the complete sourcecode for this website can be fetched with
the command:
</p>

<pre>
$ svn export <a href="http://kjew.xs4all.nl/repository/vu-website/trunk" external="true">http://kjew.xs4all.nl/repository/vu-website/trunk</a> vu-website
</pre>

<p>
But be aware. The server is behind my small DSL line with a limited upload
capacity. Also, it might not always be running. In that case, try again the
next day.
</p>

<p>
The server I am talking about is "christina", a Pentium II running Debian
Sarge with 4GB of harddisk space. I am quite happy with her.
