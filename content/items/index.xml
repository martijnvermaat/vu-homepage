<h1>Martijn Vermaat</h1>


<p>
This is my personal homepage at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam where I'm
currently a third year's student Computer Science. My main interests there
are theoretical computer science and software technology.
</p>

You can see what I look like on the picture above. I'm the one on the right,
my girlfriend Loes is on the left.

<h2>Teaching</h2>


<p>
In spring 2005, I'm practicum assistant for the course <a
href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~tcs/iti/" external="true">Inleiding Theoretische
Informatica</a>. More information can be found on a <a
href="vu/iti-2005" hreflang="nl">separate page</a> for this course.
</p>


<h2>Interests</h2>


<p>
Currently I'm mostly interested in logic in computer science (inspired by the
course <a href="vu/vl-2004">Advanced Logic</a>, <a
href="http://www.godelbook.net/" external="true">this book on Gödel's work</a>,
and <a href="http://www.few.vu.nl/~hhhansen/papers/scriptie_pic.pdf"
external="true">Helle Hansen's thesis</a>, among others) and the theory and
practice of programming languages (e.g. paradigms, compilers, semantics).
</p>

<p>
On a less theoretical note, I'm amusing myself playing with LaTeX (the <a
href="http://www.latex-project.org/" external="true">typesetting one</a> that
is), the <a href="http://www.debian.org/" external="true">Debian operating
system</a>, and small “never-to-finish” programming projects (at the moment
focussing on Python and XSLT).
</p>

<h2>Personal</h2>


<p>
Whenever there's still time left in my day, I try to spend it with my
girlfriend Loes, family, or friends. When I'm alone, I try to play some
guitar (although Loes is still unimpressed by my playing skills), and listen
to music. My alltime favourite band is <a href="http://www.sonicyouth.com/"
external="true">Sonic Youth</a>. Naming other good artists
after them would result in a infinite list, and since I'm <a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazyEvaluation" external="true">lazy</a>, I
won't do so until you ask me.

unpleasant surprise to Frege when he was just about to bring the second
volume of his Grundlagen der Arithmetik to the presses?</p>
