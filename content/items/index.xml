<h1>Martijn Vermaat</h1>


<p>
This is my personal homepage at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam where
<a href="img/martijn-southpark.png">I</a>'m a student Computer Science. My
main interests there are theoretical computer science and software technology.
</p>

<p>
As of september 2005, I'm following the master's program <a
href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~tcs/" external="true">Formal Methods and Software
Verification</a>.
</p>

<p>
During spring 2006, I'm practicum assistent for the course
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~tcs/iti/" external="true">Inleiding Theoretische
Informatica</a>. I have <a href="vu/iti-2006">some notes</a> available for the
course.
</p>


<h1>Personal</h1>


<p>
In order to do away with the classical view of a computer science student: yes,
I have a girlfriend. Her name is <a href="img/loes-southpark.png">Loes</a> and
she is an absolute expert in the field of Neuro Science. She likes chocolate
and Peking Express.
</p>


<p>
My friends <a href="http://www.alizarin.nl/" external="true">Alizarin</a> are
one of the best uilenbands. They play uilenmusic. I also like Sonic Youth and
some other bands, but they are not friends of mine.
</p>


<p>
I believe in the power of free and open information and software. This includes
in particular scientific research. For some online pointers, try my
<a href="links">Links</a> page.
