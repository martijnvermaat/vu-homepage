<h1>TisNiks</h1>


<p>
TisNiks is a small collection of Javascript functions for querying
the <a href="http://tisvu.vu.nl/" external="true">TisVU</a>
application. TisVU is an on-line interface for course
registration and listing exam results used at the Vrije Universiteit.
An example application using TisNiks is <a
href="tisniks#bbtis">BBTis</a>.
</p>

<p>
TisNiks is meant to be used in <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/"
external="true">Greasemonkey</a> user scripts. It makes
use of functionality specific to Greasemonkey, therefore TisNiks
is not suitable for use outside of Greasemonkey without some
modifications.
</p>


<h2>Using TisNiks</h2>


<p>
Currently, the way to use TisNiks in your Greasemonkey user
script is by downloading the code below and copying it to your
user script. It has only been tested with Greasemonkey 0.3.3 on
Linux.
</p>

<p>
TisNiks is Open Source and licensed under the new <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php"
external="true">BSD License</a>. This means you can pretty much do
with it whatever you like.
</p>

<p>

</p>


<h2>Development</h2>


<p>
Current features of TisNiks are just logging in and out and
querying exam results. But TisVU contains more, so TisNiks could
be extended. If you have cool ideas for TisNiks, you're welcome
to contact me and possibly get write access to the Subversion
repository containing TisNiks.
</p>

<p>
Of course, because TisNiks is free (in every sense), you can also
just take the source and extend it on your own.
</p>


<h1 id="bbtis">BBTis</h1>


<p>
As a proof-of-concept application of TisNiks, I created the BBTis
user script for Greasemonkey. It adds a section to your <a
href="http://bb.vu.nl/" external="true">VU Blackboard homepage</a>
listing your latest results from TisVU.
</p>

<p>
With BBTis installed, your Blackboard will look like this (except
for the striped-out grades of course):
</p>

<p>
<img src="files/tisniks/bbtis.png" width="548" height="420"
alt="VU Blackboard with BBTis installed" />
</p>


<h2>Installation</h2>


<p>
To install BBTis, you need Greasemonkey (and for Greasemonkey,
you need <a href="http://getfirefox.com/"
external="true">Firefox</a>). After that, follow the
following link to the latest version of BBTis, examine the source
to convince yourself I'm not stealing your passwords or anything,
and select 'Install User Script' from the 'Tools' menu in Firefox.
Accept the default configuration and go to Blackboard.
</p>

</p>


<h2>Auto-login</h2>


<p>
BBTis can be configured to automatically log in to TisVU (if
you're not already). To enable this option, locate the BBTis user
script after installation. It will be located in your Firefox
profile directory, somewhere deep down like this:
</p>

<pre>
extensions/{e4a8a97b-f2ed-450b-b12d-ee082ba24781}/chrome/greasemonkey/content/scripts/
</pre>

<p>
Open the bbtis.user.js file in an editor and adjust the
configuration section to your needs.
