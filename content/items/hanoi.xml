The Towers of Hanoi is a well-known problem that is widely used as an
example when explaining the concept of recursion. Solutions to the problem
have been constructed in numerous systems (mostly programming languages).
Try <code>M-x hanoi</code> in Emacs for a nice example.

However, I haven't been able to find a solution to the Towers of Hanoi in
Lambda Calculus. So I constructed one and wrote a short explanation on how
one would do such a thing.
